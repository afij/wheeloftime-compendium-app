The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none”—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs get fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in <a href='#Artur-Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a>'s day, except for <a href='#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan'>Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan</a>, the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the <a href='#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by <a href='#Siuan-Sanche'>Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the <a href='#Dragon-Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>.

She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and thinks she will never trust any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest. Her <a href='#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a> is <a href='#Alviarin-Freidhen'>Alviarin Freidhen</a> of the White Ajah—she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then <i>she</i> would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly. One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a crucial role in the Last Battle—this Foretelling occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another was to predict that <a href='#Rand-al-Thor'>Rand al'Thor</a> would shake the world on its very foundations—she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate, but the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, <a href='#Gawyn-Trakand'>Gawyn</a>, <a href='#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred'>Galad</a>, and <a href='#Elayne-Trakand'>Elayne</a> (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of <a href='#Tigraine-Mantear'>Tigraine</a>, <a href='#Taringail-Damodred'>Taringail</a>, Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the Dragon Reborn.

He was perhaps the most strongly <i>ta'veren</i> man besides <a href='#Lews-Therin-Telamon'>Lews Therin Telamon</a> and <a href='#Rand-al-Thor'>Rand al'Thor</a>. His armies put down those of <a href='#Guaire-Amalasan'>Guaire Amalasan</a>, a false <a href='#Dragon-Reborn'>Dragon</a>, and he even sent troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son, Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin, in hopes of conquering new lands there. All contact with these armies ended with Hawkwing's death, which set off the War of the Hundred Years. The descendants of the armies under Luthair have now returned to reclaim the lands of Hawkwing's empire in the Old World—they now call themselves the Seanchan. His sign was a golden hawk in flight."

Her final discovery there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be harnessed by men and women alike—this source turned out to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the <a href='#Dark-One'>Dark One</a>'s prison. She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into that prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of the Shadow. Around this time, Mierin had a relationship with <a href='#Lews-Therin-Telamon'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, who headed the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful and influential man she had found. Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility of power for herself through him. Mierin never let go of him, and when he later met and married <a href='#Ilyena-Therin-Moerelle'>Ilyena Moerelle</a> she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by any means. Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to get back at Lews Therin for leaving her.

She transferred her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body, <a href='#Rand-al-Thor'>Rand al'Thor</a>, after being freed from the Bore.

Along with his good friends, <a href='#Rand-al-Thor'>Rand al'Thor</a> and <a href='#Perrin-Aybara'>Perrin Aybara</a>, he left home to escape the Trolloc attack on Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protected him from women's channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat's <i>ta'veren</i> qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games—he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including <a href='#Eldrin-Cauthon'>Eldrin</a> and <a href='#Bodewhin-Bode-Cauthon'>Bodewhin</a>, who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father <a href='#Abell-Cauthon'>Abell</a> is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked—his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she is not the <a href='#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons'>Daughter of the Nine Moons</a>, who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it deeply. He has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him—which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is “to die and live again.” He currently heads an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general—this works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even <a href='#Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere'>Davram Bashere</a>, who has earned his good reputation as one of the best commanders alive.

She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by <a href='#Moiraine-Damodred'>Moiraine</a> and <a href='#al-Lan-Mandragoran'>Lan</a>. While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for al'Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a Novice, despite not being able to even <i>sense</i> the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by <a href='#Liandrin'>Liandrin</a> on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as <a href='#Egwene-al-Vere'>Egwene</a> was. After she returned to the Tower, <a href='#Siuan-Sanche'>Siuan Sanche</a> sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered <a href='#Moghedien'>Moghedien</a> and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an <i>a'dam</i> in <i>Tel'aran'rhiod</i>. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out <a href='#Rand-al-Thor'>Rand</a> and <a href='#Rahvin'>Rahvin</a> while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve now keeps Moghedien under control with a modified <i>a'dam</i> in Salidar. Nynaeve wishes to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, from severing to the wound on Rand's side. Nynaeve felt bad when <a href='#Moiraine-Damodred'>Moiraine</a> died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to another at the moment of her death, or who that person is."

At the moment of Creation, the Dark One was imprisoned by the Creator at Shayol Ghul. This prison kept the Dark One from touching the world until it was bored into by humans during the Age of Legends. This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until <a href='#Lews-Therin-Telamon'>Lews Therin Telamon</a>, the Dragon, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison. At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting <i>saidin</i> itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were found, they were placed: (1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); (2) in the hands of Bayle Domon, later pilfered by High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broke at the battle of Falme), (3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection (broken at the battle at Falme); (4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); (5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broke enroute to Salidar); (6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and (7) Found by <a href='#Mazrim-Taim'>Mazrim Taim</a> (still intact). Despite being made of <i>cuendillar</i>, the three that remain unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.
