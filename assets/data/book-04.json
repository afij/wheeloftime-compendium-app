In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feels an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not really want to (though they have yet to reveal these sentiments to each other). Egwene is the love interest of both of Elayne's brothers, <a href='#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred'>Galad</a> and <a href='#Gawyn-Trakand'>Gawyn</a>—she is flattered by Galad's attentions, but she does not return them; she does find Gawyn to her liking, however. Egwene, along with Elayne and <a href='#Nynaeve-al-Meara'>Nynaeve</a> is one of the only people <a href='#Siuan-Sanche'>Siuan Sanche</a> trusts in the Tower; Siuan is convinced through their actions to date that they cannot possibly be Darkfriends.

Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style). When Lan and Moiraine brought <a href='#Rand-al-Thor'>Rand</a>, <a href='#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon'>Mat</a>, <a href='#Perrin-Aybara'>Perrin</a>, <a href='#Egwene-al-Vere'>Egwene</a>, and <a href='#Nynaeve-al-Meara'>Nynaeve</a> out of their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it: affection for Nynaeve. As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise (and Lan's), loves him in return. His favorite colors on women are green, blue, and white—Nynaeve's wardrobe just happened to become rich in those colors once she found out."
