Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none”—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs get fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since <a href='#Bonwhin-Meraighdin'>Bonwhin</a>, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in <a href='#Artur-Hawkwing'>Artur Hawkwing</a>'s day, except for <a href='#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan'>Elaida a'Roihan</a>, the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last five Amyrlins (not counting Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the <a href='#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles'>Keeper of the Chronicles</a>, who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by <a href='#Siuan-Sanche'>Siuan Sanche</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the <a href='#Dragon-Reborn'>Dragon Reborn</a>.

She tried to use the Tower's influence to manipulate Hawkwing and make him a puppet ruler of the White Tower. This ended in disaster, as Hawkwing laid seige to Tar Valon and attempted to destroy the Aes Sedai stronghold—he nearly succeeded. Bonwhin was stripped of stole and staff and stilled for nearly destroying the Tower, and since then no Amyrlin from her Ajah has been raised. She was succeeded by Deane Aryman of the Blue Ajah, who attempted to undo the damage Bonwhin did to the Tower's reputation, and succeeded for the most part. Unfortunately, this created extreme tension between the Red and Blue Ajahs that still exists today, and is the main reason why the Red Ajah will (and did) take any pretext to pull down an Amyrlin raised from the Blue Ajah."

For this act, people remember him with a new name: <a href='#Kinslayer'>Kinslayer</a>. After he had done this, <a href='#Ishamael'>Ishamael</a> gave him his sanity back long enough for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by drawing on <i>saidin</i> too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the spot where he stood. This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the present-day city of Tar Valon. It is unfortunate that the name of one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to kill them. Lews Therin's voice sometimes speaks inside <a href='#Rand-al-Thor'>Rand</a>'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost women, but is getting more and more vocal."

Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style).

As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise and his, loves him in return."
