    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <sub>For the Wheel of Time Character Compendium (Unofficial)</sub>
    <p><em>This document was last updated on September 24, 2022.</em></p>

    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) 
    is being used within the Wheel of Time Character Compendium. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that 
    can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. 
    Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally 
    Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>


    <h4>What do we collect?</h4>
    <p>Nothing! We do not track any of your interactions within the application.</p>

    <h4><strong>When do we collect information?</strong></h4>
    <p>Never! At no point do we enable any sort of user tracking or data capture.</p>

    <h4><strong>How do we use your information? </strong></h4>
    <p>We don't! We use only what we collect: <strong>NOTHING.</strong></p>

    <h4><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></h4>
    <p>At times, the application will reach out to the web in order to retrieve information. These requests are always secured with HTTPS.<br></p>

    <h4><strong>Do we use 'cookies'?</strong></h4>
    <p>No!</p>

    <h4><strong>Third-party disclosure</strong></h4>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

    <h4><strong>Third-party links</strong></h4>
    <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services in the application. These third-party sites 
    have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these 
    linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

    <h4><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></h4>
    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
     stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites 
     collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly 
     the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: 
     http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>
    
    <p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong><br></p>
    <p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
    <p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
    <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page</p>

    <p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>
    <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
    <p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>
    <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>

    <h4><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></h4>
    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 
    puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators 
    of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
    <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

    <h4><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></h4>
    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant 
    role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is 
    critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

    <p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days</li>
        <li>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data 
    collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, 
    but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
